I"Ì<p>When can we consider the code we write â€œgood enoughâ€? For some, a passing build
is good enough. For others perhaps itâ€™s a passing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing">acceptance
suite</a>. Maybe itâ€™s the
existence of unit tests that define completion, with a specific code coverage
percentage. These options are all quantifiable, which makes them simple targets
to aspire to. We can go further than that and push for something less tangible
but more worthwhile.  All apprentices at 8th Light undertake a project called
the HTTP Server. Itâ€™s no small undertaking, and consequently brings up numerous
occasions to question whether the code you have written is â€œgood enoughâ€.</p>
