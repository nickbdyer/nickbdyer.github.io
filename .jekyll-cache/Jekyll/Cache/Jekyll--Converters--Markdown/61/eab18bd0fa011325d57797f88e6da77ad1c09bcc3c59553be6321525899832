I"<p>Feedback is the fundamental ingredient to personal growth. Without it, learning
and self-improvement become very difficult. There has been plenty written about
how to <em>give</em> feedback, in fact only last week here at 8th Light London we were
given a workshop on “Giving Compassionate Feedback”. However, there seems to be
less written about <em>receiving</em> feedback. Since not everyone we interact with
will be experts in giving compassionate feedback, it is probably worthwhile to
take a look at how best to receive it.</p>
