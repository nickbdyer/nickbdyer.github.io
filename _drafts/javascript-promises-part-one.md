The apprenticeship at 8th Light exposes people to three programming paradigms,
functional, object oriented and dynamic. It does not, however, place much
emphasis on Javascript. It's odd given it's prolific use. Day one as
a craftsman and I am working directly with the javascript part of a code base.
Fortunately for my last job had my working entirely in full stack javascript.
