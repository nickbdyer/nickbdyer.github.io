I have recently taken over the application process at 8th Light's London
Office. During the meeting where I offered to take on that role a colleague,
Daniel, suggested that we take a look into removing bias from our applications
process. Daniel is a driving force behind 8th Light's diversity programme in
London.

As part of the #london-diversity Slack channel, we have recently been reading
"The Loudest Duck" by Laura Liswood.

Anonymisation Script

Most of this script should be relatively straight forward. I'll just pick out
a couple of lines that are more likely to be unfamiliar.

The purpose of this line is to accumlate all the branches and rename them. Most
applicants unsurpsingly use "master" as their submission branch. However, if
the applicant has been diligent with pull requests, then residual branches can
be interesting to see, and are preserved through this command.
