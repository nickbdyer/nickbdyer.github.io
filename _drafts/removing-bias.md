I have recently taken over the application process at 8th Light's London
Office. During the meeting where I offered to take on that role a colleague,
Daniel, suggested that we take a look into removing bias from our applications
process. Daniel is a driving force behind 8th Light's diversity programme in
London.

As part of the #london-diversity Slack channel, we have recently been reading
"The Loudest Duck" by Laura Liswood.
