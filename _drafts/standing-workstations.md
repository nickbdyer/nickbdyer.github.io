Our London office took delivery of two standing desks last week, due in no
small part to my reading of Deskbound by Kelly Starett. When this book was
released last year, news of it quickly spread around my gym, and for a few
weeks it was all any of the coaches could talk about. Every class featured some
new mobilisation routine, or referenced Kelly's tips on maintaining a strong
posture.

In between the various bits of advice the book offers, there are facts and tid
bits about the state of the world, in particular our health. It drew a number
of things to my attention, things that were obvious, but too often too close to
see. Kelly cites the invention of the chair as the worst thing to happen to
people's health and mobility, ever.

Another eye opening section of the book hooked me on the benefits of squatting.
In order to catch my attention it asks, "Who knows somebody who has had a hip
problem?". I asked this question to the 8th Light office, and not a single
person kept their hand down. It is an interesting question, when you consider
that no other joint seems to hold such a profilic graps on people's health.
When you then consider that since the invention of the chair, most people have
never full used their hip joint again. We permenantly operate at a 90ยบ angle at
our hips.
