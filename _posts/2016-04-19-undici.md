Documentation.

This morning was spent assessing my Java TTT through the process of building
an UML diagram. As it stands this is not the final version, since I neglected
to add methods to each of the listed classes. Even without that though, you can
see at a glance how messy the diagram looks, which is a strong sign that my
classes are a bit too dependent on each other.

I will continue to work on this diagram a little bit tomorrow and post the
updated version. It is a representation of my project as it currently stands,
it will be interesting to see how this diagram changes by the end of the
project. 

The afternoon was spent dealing with a story for streamlining the usage of my
TTT on other peoples laptops. I had hoped it would be a simple process, and to
be fair it only took half a day, but in hindsight I think an hour might have
been more appropriate if only the documentation had been better. 

It's difficult to judge documentation sometimes, because everyone approaches it
with a different aim in mind. So for my usage it wasn't good enough, but
perhaps for someone else it would be. That said, it was surprising to me that
some of the basics were difficult to find, the Gradle Application plugin for
example, is meant to allow you to "run" your program through just two lines in
your build file:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'application'

mainClassName = "com.company.Main"
```

Nowhere in the documentation could I find notice that the standard in and out
are overwritten when doing so. So, the program would run perfectly if executed
through IntelliJ and through the compiled jar file, but would raise exceptions
when using `gradle run`. After sometime spent trying to determine what the
issue actually was, I found an answer on Stackoverflow. 

Add this to your `build.gradle`

```groovy
run {
    standardInput = System.in
}
```

I've never had to write much documentation outside of accompanying an API,
however, I can see how for something as big as gradle it could be a daunting
process. Perhaps the solution lies in monitoring stackoverflow for questions
and determining where the holes are in your documentation.
