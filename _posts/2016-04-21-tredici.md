## Temporal Coupling

### Situation

This is what I'm looking at.

##### **Board Class**

```java
public boolean hasWinner() {
    return new Lines(cells).hasAWinner();
}

public Mark getWinningMark() {
    return new Lines(cells).getWinningMark(); // Temporal coupling.
}
```

##### **Lines Class**

```java
private Mark winningMark;

public Mark getWinningMark() {
    return winningMark; // Temporal coupling.
}

public boolean hasAWinner() {
    return checkLinesForAllMatchingElements();
}

private boolean checkLinesForAllMatchingElements() {
    for (List<Mark> line : possibleCombinations()) {
        if (hasAllMatchingElements(line)) {
            winningMark = line.get(0); // Assignment occurs here.
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Complication

As noted by the inline comment, this code suffers from temporal coupling.
During gameplay this issue does not occur, since the gameplay loop prevents
getWinningMark() from being called before the game has a winner. However, in
testing this method, the test fails unless hasWinner() is called in the test
first. 

### Question

How can the code be altered here in order to remove the temporal coupling and
make improve the flexibility overall? 

### Answer One

Modify the Lines class to call checkLinesForAllMatchingElements(). This keeps
the temporal coupling, but means the tests pass and the functionality is there.
For the sake of running one loop again, it is not particularly problematic, but
it feels wrong.

##### **Lines Class**

```java
private Mark winningMark;

public Mark getWinningMark() {
    checkLinesForAllMatchingElements();
    return winningMark; // Temporal coupling.
}

public boolean hasAWinner() {
    return checkLinesForAllMatchingElements();
}

private boolean checkLinesForAllMatchingElements() {
    for (List<Mark> line : possibleCombinations()) {
        if (hasAllMatchingElements(line)) {
            winningMark = line.get(0);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Answer Two

By initialising `winningMark` as `null`, we can do a check for null here and
avoid a null pointer exception. In fact winningMark will be null if it is not
initialised, but at least in specifying it that is no longer a surprise.    This
is sort of OK, but null is pretty grimey, so I'd like to avoid it. This
solution doesn't give much information to anyone using the class why the null
check exists.

##### **Lines Class**

```java
private Mark winningMark = null;

public Mark getWinningMark() {
    if (winningMark == null) {
        return EMPTY;
    }
    return winningMark; 
}

public boolean hasAWinner() {
    return checkLinesForAllMatchingElements();
}

private boolean checkLinesForAllMatchingElements() {
    for (List<Mark> line : possibleCombinations()) {
        if (hasAllMatchingElements(line)) {
            winningMark = line.get(0);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Answer Three

By throwing a unchecked exception, the public API for the Board class is
descriptive.    However, it is on a par with Answer Two for laziness. It
would probably better to avoid the exception in the first place. 

##### **PrematureException Class**

```java

public class PrematureException extends RuntimeException {

    public PrematureException() {
        super("You have called this method before there is a winner.");
    }

}

```

##### **Lines Class**

```java
private Mark winningMark;

public Mark getWinningMark() {
    if (winningMark == null) {
        throw new PrematureException();
    }
    return winningMark;
}

public boolean hasAWinner() {
    return checkLinesForAllMatchingElements();
}

private boolean checkLinesForAllMatchingElements() {
    for (List<Mark> line : possibleCombinations()) {
        if (hasAllMatchingElements(line)) {
            winningMark = line.get(0);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Answer Four

Java Optionals allow a value to be unspecified without having to deal with
checks for null. From my point of view this only marginally better than a null
check, the logic is the same but the syntax is improved.

##### **Lines Class**

```java

private Optional<Mark> winningMark = Optional.empty();


public Mark getWinningMark() {
    return winningMark.orElse(EMPTY);
}

public boolean hasAWinner() {
    return checkLinesForAllMatchingElements();
}

private boolean checkLinesForAllMatchingElements() {
    for (List<Mark> line : possibleCombinations()) {
        if (hasAllMatchingElements(line)) { 
            winningMark = Optional.of(line.get(0));
                return true;
            }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Answer Five

In order to avoid the situation entirely, a better solution is for the game to
keep track of each mark that is played. So that if at any point the game ends
in a "Win" condition, then it can query for the last mark used since that will
always be the winner.
