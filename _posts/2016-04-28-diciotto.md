## Decorator Pattern

At the end of yesterday's post I hinted that my DelayedComputer was tied to the
DumbComputer and that it might be necessary to also delay the PerfectComputer.
That turned out to be the case almost immediately. 

The first solution that came to mind was to create a DelayedPerfectComputer,
that simply extended the PerfectComputer and overrode the choosePosition
method. However, that would mean I'd end up with two new classes that both
extended different classes in exactly the same way. What if I needed to create
yet another computer player, for example the CheatingComputer. If that also
need to be delayed I'd end up creating yet another delay class.

How is it possible to have a new class represent two other classes but with
extra features? 

#### Original Delayed Computer

```java
public class DelayedComputer extends DumbComputer {

    private int delay;

    public DelayedComputer(Mark mark, int delay) {
        super(mark);
        this.delay = delay;
    }

    @Override
    public int choosePosition(UserInterface ui, Board board) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(delay);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        return super.choosePosition(ui, board);
    }
}
```

So there are a couple of issues with this, firstly it is coupled specificially
to the DumbComputer class, but also in order to test this I have to pass
a delay figure in of 0 so that the test suite isn't increased in length.

So, the first part of the solution is to convert the DelayedComputer player
into a decorator and then deal with the issue of delays.

#### Decorator Delayed Computer

```java
public class DelayedComputer implements Player {

    private int delay;
    private Player player;

    public DelayedComputer(Player player, int delay) {
        this.player = player;
        this.delay = delay;
    }

    @Override
    public int choosePosition(UserInterface ui, Board board) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(delay);
            ui.displayComputerThinking();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        return player.choosePosition(ui, board);
    }

    public Mark getMark() {
        return player.getMark();
    }
}
```
So now, anytype of Player including Human, can have a delay added to their
choosePosition method. This is a much better implementation since it allows the
delay to be added to both classes, without modifying those classes. 

Finally, I needed to deal with the actual delay issue. This was solved through
some Dependency Inversion. 

#### Decorator Delayed Computer

```java
public class DelayedComputer implements Player {

    private int delay;
    private Delayer delayer;
    private Player player;

    public DelayedComputer(Player player, Delayer delayer, int delay) {
        this.player = player;
        this.delayer = delayer;
        this.delay = delay;
    }

    @Override
    public int choosePosition(UserInterface ui, Board board) {
        delayer.sleep(delay);
        return player.choosePosition(ui, board);
    }

    public Mark getMark() {
        return player.getMark();
    }
}
```

#### Delayer Interface

```java
public interface Delayer {
    void sleep(int delay);
}
```

#### ThreadDelayer

```java
public class ThreadDelayer implements Delayer {

    @Override
    public void sleep(int delay) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(delay);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### MockDelayer

```java
public class MockDelayer implements Delayer {

    public boolean hasSleepBeenCalled;

    public MockDelayer() {
        this.hasSleepBeenCalled = false;
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep(int delay) {
        hasSleepBeenCalled = true;
    }
}
```

A nicely decoupled solution with some flexibility for later. Should it be
required, I is not too much work to create an abstract PlayerDecorator class
that would allow other additions to their behaviour as appropriate. For now
though, the delay is sufficient.
