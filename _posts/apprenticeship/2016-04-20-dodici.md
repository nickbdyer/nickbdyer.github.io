Zagaku Time!

Yesterday I completed a simple UML diagram by showing dependencies between
classes. Today I extended that diagram by adding methods and their return
values. This improved the diagram considerably, and helped to highlight issues
where I was using public methods where it wasn't necessary.

It's my first Zagaku presentation tomorrow. Initially, I was struggling a bit
on what to talk about, but some of the other apprentices and craftspeople
suggested I talk a little about my previous experience at Atos Consulting. This
gave me an opportunity to rethink some of the ideas and concepts I learnt
whilst there and do a bit of research around them. The talk I am going to
present will be on a tactic used to improve written communication. When I was
previously taught it, it was just a standard consulting tool. I can see now it
has wide ranging applicability on all styles of written communication including
blog posts. I will spend a bit of time thinking about it today, because it
should be a good structure for my technical writing.

I have a suitable part two approaching from this Zagaku too. I don't want to give
too much away in this blog post though.

Finally I spent the last part of the day doing some refactoring and discovered
just how easy IntelliJ makes it. More refactoring tomorrow, I'd like to really
tidy up the whole code base if possible. I will talk a bit more about the
refactoring I am doing and where the issues lie, a lot of it will relate to the
revised UML diagram below.
