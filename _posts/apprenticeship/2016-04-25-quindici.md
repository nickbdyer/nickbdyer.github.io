Overwriting Equals.

After yesterday's success in testing the PlayerFactory I was ready to start
moving on to complete the rest of my iteration.

However, early this morning I discovered that overwriting equals is actually
a code smell and should be avoided whereever possible.

How then can we test the creation of two new instances of players. The answer
is another code smell unfortunately, but in this case allowable. `instanceof`.

The tests for PlayerFactory now look like this, and the overwriting of equals
and hashcode have been removed.

```java
@Test
public void canCreateTwoHumanPlayers() {
    PlayerFactory pfactory = new PlayerFactory();
    assertTrue(pfactory.create(1).get(0) instanceof Human);
    assertTrue(pfactory.create(1).get(1) instanceof Human);
}

@Test
public void canCreateAHumanAndComputerPlayer() {
    PlayerFactory pfactory = new PlayerFactory();
    assertTrue(pfactory.create(2).get(0) instanceof Human);
    assertTrue(pfactory.create(2).get(1) instanceof DumbComputer);
}
```

Mateu also pointed out another code smell to me today, one that I hadn't
realised. I'm writing here in the hope that I'll remember it!

```java
public Game(List<Player> players) {
    this.players = players;
    this.currentPlayer = players.get(0);
    //   this.player1 = currentPlayer = players.get(0);
    //   this.player2 = players.get(1);
}
```

Assigining `player1` to `players.get(0)` implied that there was a restriction
and assumption of knowledge in the game.  Mateu and hence this was a code
smell, almost like repetition. The commented out code will be removed in favour
of the more robust `this.players = players`. This allows for the possibility of
more than two players in the game of tictactoe.
