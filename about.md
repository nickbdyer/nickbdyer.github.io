A little about me: I studied Music and Sound Recording at University, which led
me to a career in Audio Visual Automation for 5 years. During that time, I had
some exposure to coding, enough to eventually take a lead and leave my job for
a short intensive course with Makers Academy. The course led me to a job as
a consultant developer. I enjoyed my time there, but when I heard I had an
offer to study under the craftsman at 8th Light, it was too good an opportunity
to turn down!

Outside of work, I do CrossFit for a regular workout, and also enjoy
photography whenever the opportunity arises.
