A little about me: 

I studied Music and Sound Recording at University, which led me to a career in
Audio Visual Automation for 5 years. During that time, I had some exposure to
programming, enough to eventually take a leap and leave my job for a short intensive
course with Makers Academy. The course led me to a job as a consultant
developer. I enjoyed my time, but when I heard I had an offer to study
under the craftsman at 8th Light, it was too good an opportunity to turn down!

Outside of work, I do CrossFit for a regular workout, and also enjoy
photography whenever the opportunity arises.
