I studied Music and Sound Recording at University, which led me to a career in
Audio Visual Automation. During that time, I had some exposure to programming,
enough to eventually take a leap and pick up a new skill in programming with
Makers Academy. The course led me to a role as a software consultant,
which I have been doing ever since.
